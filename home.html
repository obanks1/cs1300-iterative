      <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
      <h3>a case study on the design process</h3>
      <div class="whitebox smallshadow">
        <h6><b>Objective:</b> Work in a small group to design an interface for an emerging startup.
           Sketch ideas of the interface, create an interactive high-fidelity prototype, and 
           conduct user testing on this final prototype. 
        <h6><b>Subject:</b> DRAPR, an online shopping startup</h6>
        <div class="centered"><hr class="inlinehr"/>

    <h3>The Startup</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered">
      <div style="width: 70%;">
        <p>
          <b>DRAPR</b> builds software to help online shoppers see what their clothing looks like. 
          The company’s online try-on widget helps shoppers get a better idea of how a shirt or 
          other clothing item fits on a customizable 3D mannequin that users can adjust to fit 
          their body type, height and weight.
        </p>
        <p><b>Type of Interface: </b>Desktop website</p>
        <p><b>Users: </b>This website is marketing DRAPR to online shopping retailers who want to
        make it easy for their customers to virtually try on clothes. This could reduce return
        rate and prevent dissatisfied customers. It will be especially helpful for customers
        who have unusual body shapes or sizes. More people are buying clothing online due to 
        the pandemic, and don’t have the option to try on clothes in stores, making DRAPR a 
        timely alternative.

    <br>

    <h3>Sketches</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center;">We made 4 sketches of what the website might look like.</p>
    <div class="centered"><div class="sketchdiv">
      <div class="sketch whitebox"><img src="photos/sketch1.png" alt="image of 1st sketch"></div>

    <h3>Wireframe</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered"><div class="centered" style="width: 60%">
    <p style="width: 50%">We put together the best ideas from all of our sketches to create a wireframe
      mockup. These are some of the features we knew we wanted to include in the prototype 
      <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact Us box</li>

    <h3>First HiFI Mockup</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered">
      <p style="width: 60%"><b>Design Choices: </b>We chose one font (Merriweather) and kept it consistent through
      the website. We also kept our button design visually consistent. We chose to make the 
      website infinite scroll, but include a navbar so that frequent users could reach their
      destinations more quickly. We also used a background image, and put transluscent blocks 
      behind the text to make it more readable.</p>

    <h3>Critical Feedback</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered"><div class="centered" style="width: 60%">
      <p style="width: 40%">We had a mockup crit, wherein we received feedback on our design from an industry professional and our classmates. These are some of their suggestions, which we implemented below.
        <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No back button on checkout page</li>
        <li>Can't see package prices on main page</li>
        <li>Split the checkout page into login and payment</li>
        <li>Hard to find checkout</li>
        <li>No affordances to indicate that page scrolls</li>
        <li>Match nav headers to the content headings</li>
        <li>"Click to Customize" is positioned so it points to nothing</li>
        <li>Button alignment should be consistent between pages (center all)</li>
      </ul>
    </div></div>

    <h3>User Testing</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered"><div style="width:60%">
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        We sent our prototype to usertesting.com and gave 3 users the following instructions:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Scenario: </b> You are an employee for a clothing company. You are looking for 
        additional features to add to your website to improve the shopping experience. 
        Drapr is a company that offers virtual “try-it-on” software that can be embedded 
        into websites. You will be evaluating the different plans that Drapr offers, 
        and purchasing a plan for your clothing company.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Overall Task: </b> Navigate the website, and purchase a plan. Once the plan 
        is purchased, send a message to the PR team to get in touch with the company. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Subtasks: </b>
        The interface below is a prototype mockup of a potential website. 
        As such, not all links/features will be clickable. However, the main features of 
        the prototype are functioning (including all features requested in the below subtasks). 
      </p>
      <p>Please attempt to complete the following tasks in order. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Scroll down the website, taking note of the main features offered by the product</li>
        <li>Select the “Basic Plan” from the plans offered</li>
        <li>“Create an Account” to use for purchasing the plan</li>
        <li>Enter billing details and confirm the purchase</li>
        <li>Return to the homepage</li>
        <li>Send a brief message to the PR team using the “Contact Us” feature</li>
        <li>Return to the homepage</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Post-Task Questions:</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Did you face any challenges while using the website? If so, what were they?</li>
        <li>On a scale of 1-10, how intuitive do you find the website design?</li>
        <li>Are there any additional features that you would have liked on the website?</li>
        <li>Is there anything else you would like to tell us/any additional comments you have?</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Summary of Results</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered"><p style="width: 80%; text-align: center;">
      Overall, we were fairly pleased with the results we obtained from the user testing experiments.
    </p></div>
    <div class="centered"><div style="width: 80%">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Navigating through the homepage was generally in line with expectations. We were surprised 
          to find that one of the users still had a bit of difficulty figuring out that the website 
          scrolled (even with affordances such as peaking and a small arrow on the bottom of the page)
        </li>
        <li>
          Since the website was small, we found that users generally remember where to go for the 
          latter subtasks (Contact Us, etc…). However, this relied on recall rather than intuition 
          (the users specifically stated that they “remembered where on the page this form was”)
        </li>
        <li>
          Some users asked for a bit more specificity on the “try-it-on” widget (especially those 
          users who were more unfamiliar with clothing sizing)
        </li>
        <li>
          When selecting the plans, users were generally able to navigate without errors. One user
           suggested creating more contrasting color palettes in the actual choice icons for the 
           different plans
        </li>
        <li>
          Users were dissatisfied with the vagueness of the landing page after sending a message 
          to the PR team. They would have preferred to know an exact timeframe for receiving a 
          response (we had a message that said “A representative of our time will reach out shortly” 
          with no concrete timeframe)
        </li>
        <li>
          We were happy to see that after the users figured out the scrolling mechanism, they made 
          no errors on any of the subsequent tasks. We received feedback from those users that the 
          navigation was simple and easy to use
        </li>
        <li>Some users also commented on the landing page after checking out and purchasing a product. 
          It appears users really prefer concrete steps and actions on confirmation pages (i.e a 
          confirmation email has been sent - reach out if you don’t get it in 10 minutes, a 
          representative will reach out in 1-2 days, etc…)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div></div>
    

    <br>
    <h3>Interface Changes</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="centered"><div style="width: 80%">
      <ul>
        <li>Our biggest change would be to make the affordances even more clear for scrolling. 
          Not understanding the scroll made the website nearly completely unusable, so perhaps a 
          scrolling bar on the right of the page or something similar would ensure this mistake is 
          not made.
        </li>
        <li>We would add a bit more detail and information on the landing pages for the “checkout” 
          and “contact us” buttons. This would reassure customers that they performed the correct tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          We might change the color scheme slightly on the icons for the three different plans. As is, 
          it may be a bit difficult for customers to intuitively and immediately grasp the idea that 
          the plans are radically different given the similarity in color schemes.
        </li>
        <li>
          We might make fewer assumptions on familiarity with the exact measurements required for using the “try-it-on” widget and perhaps add a “help” icon that walks users through the steps of taking the necessary steps to use the widget.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users generally relied on recall rather than intuition for navigating to specific elements on the scrollable home page. In the future we would add a clickable navigation bar on the top of the page that takes users directly to different sections of the page.
        </li>
        <ul><li>
          Note: We considered implementing this feature in our original prototype, but unfortunately Figma did not have this functionality. Given its importance, we would definitely implement this in a real website.
        </li></ul>
      </ul>
    </div></div>

          <h6>This project taught us that there are often hidden usability issues in a design that can only be found with outside feedback. Both the critique and the user testing proved invaluable for exposing usability issues. We learned that it's important to consult a wide variety of opinions, because demographics like age can affect how intuitive users find an interface.</h6>
